                           <p>Choose the size of pizza I want e.g Small, Medium, Large

                            Place an order for my Pizza and see the total charge for it.
                            Have an option to order as many pizzas as I want.
                            Have an option to have the pizza delivered or not.  If delivered I want to be alerted how much the delivery charge will be.
                            If I want my pizza to be delivered, I want to be prompted to enter where the delivery should be made and an alert saying '' your order will be delivered to your location"
                            See a checkout button that when clicked shows the total amount charged for the orders.</p>

                        <p>This was the second week's project really interesting. Moringa not only teaches students about code but also introduces them to new culture like the ghana project.</p>
